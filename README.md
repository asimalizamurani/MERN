# My Daily Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my GitHub repository! Here, I document everything I’m learning on my journey to becoming a full-stack developer. This space is regularly updated with projects, experiments, and notes as I build my skills day by day.

## 📝 What’s Inside

### Full Stack Course Journey

I’m currently learning full-stack web development from Hitesh Choudhary's course on Udemy. Hitesh Choudhary is an amazing teacher, breaking down complex topics and making them approachable. This repository reflects my progress and understanding as I apply each concept learned in his course, from frontend basics to advanced backend skills.

### Completed Topics

- **HTML & CSS**: Basics of web structure and styling.
- **JavaScript**: Core concepts, ES6+ features, DOM manipulation, and more.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling to build responsive designs quickly.
- **JavaScript Projects**: 
  - Completed 5 projects (details below).
  
### JavaScript Projects 📂

1. **To-Do App with Local Storage**: A task management app that saves tasks locally so they persist even when the browser is closed.
2. **API Handling**: Demonstrates fetching data from external APIs and displaying it dynamically.
3. **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add, remove, and view items in a cart, complete with item count and total cost.
4. **Expense Tracker**: A budgeting tool to log expenses and visualize spending habits.
5. **Quiz App**: A simple quiz interface where users can answer questions, see scores, and get feedback.

More projects coming soon as I learn new concepts!
